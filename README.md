# Gimp-Appimages-Made-From-Debs
Using the brilliant Shradiko app to make Gimp appimages for use on Ubuntu and similar systems.

_____________________________________________________________________________
By using Ubuntu deb files the appimages conform more closely to the operating system.
User plug-ins and scripts are in $HOME/.config/GIMP/2.10/
The 'Gimp2-10-30Ubu_22-04.AppImage' was made on Ubuntu LTS 22.04 but works better on the current LTS Ubuntu 20.04 version.

Any isues post in 'issues ' on the github page.
